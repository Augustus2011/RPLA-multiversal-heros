    "description": "A brilliant but arrogant New York surgeon, Dr. Stephen Strange's life was turned upside down when a car crash caused irreparable nerve damage to his hands, preventing him from ever holding a scalpel again. Driven by arrogance and desperation, he traveled the world in search of a cure, finally arriving in Tibet to seek the help of the Ancient One, a powerful wizard and (unbeknownst to him) the Sorcerer Supreme, the mage charged with protecting the Earth from the otherdimensional Cosmic menaces who would threaten it.\n\nSensing his great magical potential, the Ancient One asked Strange to become his new apprentice, and the now humbled Strange accepted.\n\nAfter years of study, he moved back to New York and engaged in many mystical adventures and fought many wicked foes, including the vengeful Mordo, the Dread Dormammu and the abominable Shuma-Gorath, who caused the death of the Ancient One, leading to Strange inheriting his title and responsibilities",
