    "description": "Diana is a very kind, loving, compassionate, and strong-willed person, who, while initially somewhat naive, has become all the wiser through her time in Man's World. An outspoken egalitarian, she fights for what she believes in and generally for the betterment of mankind through love and mutual understanding, as taught to her by her mother and fellow Amazons. Growing up, Diana also proved herself headstrong and determined to do what she wanted. She is also quite stubborn; if she believes something is the right thing to do, then she will do it. Diana is portrayed by #GalGadot and #EmilyCarey (young Diana).",
