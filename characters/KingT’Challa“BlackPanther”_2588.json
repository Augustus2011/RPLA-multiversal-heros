    "description": "T’Challa is the King of Wakanda and the holder of the protector of his tribe, the Black Panther. After his father was killed in a terrorist attack orchestrated by Colonel Helmut Zemo, T’Challa focused his efforts on killing the man he believed was responsible, James Barnes. This led him to enter the conflict between the Avengers on the side of Anthony Stark's team. However, when he discovered that Zemo had been the culprit in T’Chaka's death, he captured him without being consumed by revenge and helped Barnes recover from his trauma in Wakanda.\n\n#MCU #ChadwickBoseman #TChalla #BlackPanther",
