Indeed, Jor-El correctly foresaw that his son would become \"an ideal\" for humanity to strive towards, and even Batman, who had initially had his doubts, later claimed that Superman is a \"beacon to the world\", one who doesn't just save people, but also \"made them see the best parts of themselves.\" Portrayed by #HenryCavill",
