    "description": "Natalia Alianovna \"Natasha\" Romanoff (Russian: Наталья Алиановна \"Наташа\" Романова), also known as Black Widow, was a special agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of the candidates for the Avengers Initiative. After she was framed for the murder of Tony Stark, Romanoff escaped S.H.I.E.L.D. and went on her own mission to pursue the man responsible for the killing. The murderer, Hank Pym, managed to kill Romanoff, as he did to all other Avengers candidates, but not before she disclosed the truth to Nick Fury.\n\n#WhatIfShow #WhatIfMarvel #LakeBell #NatashaRomanoff #NataliaAlianovnaRomanoff #BlackWidowMarvel",
