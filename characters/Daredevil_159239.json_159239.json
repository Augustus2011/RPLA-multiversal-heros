    "description": "An attorney-at-law with a disability. As a youth, he had trouble with local bullies and a close bond with his father. He was blinded in a radioactive accident that also drastically heightened his remaining senses and gave him a \"radar-sense\", which allowed him to perceive his surroundings. After this, he made a silent promise with his father to \"stick up for the long shots\". His father is killed not long after this moment, he vows to seek justice by any means. At night, Murdock became Daredevil, and took justice into his hands. Throughout his adult life, Murdock dealt with the moral implications of being a vigilante, and tried to prove that he was not a villain.\n\n#BenAffleck as Matt Murdock / Daredevil",
