    "description": "After getting bitten by a scientifically-altered spider, Peter Parker gained the ability to crawl on walls and sense nearby threats, along with enhanced strength and agility. When his uncle was killed by a criminal, he learned that With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility and vowed to use his abilities to protect others as the superhero Spider-Man... All of which has happened offscreen by the time we actually meet him.\n\nA few months later, Spider-Man was drafted into a conflict between the Avengers by Iron Man, gaining a new suit in the process. While seeking to prove that he's good enough to join the Avengers, Peter was able to take on a smaller threat on his own, proving his worth. However, Peter ultimately turned down the offer to become an Avenger, realizing that he can do more good in New York City, an area that the Avengers can't usually cover. But when an alien invasion threatens New York once again, Spider-Man is officially inducted into their ranks by Iron Man.",
