    "description": "Peter Jason Quill, better known by his alias Star-Lord, is a Marvel Comics character created by Steve Englehart and Steve Gan, first showing up in Marvel Preview #4 (January 1976).\n\nDescribed by co-creator Englehart as \"an unpleasant, introverted jerk\" who becomes \"the most cosmic being in the universe,\" Star-Lord was a product of Englehart's newfound interest in astronomy at the time. Fans of the character's current iteration reading this might laugh at how much he's changed since. In any event, Peter was originally presented as an arrogant, anti-social astronaut who accidentally became an outer space badass, and only some of those qualities have been retained through the years.",
