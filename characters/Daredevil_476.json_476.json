    "description": "Matthew \"Matt\" Murdock is a blind lawyer by day and masked crimefighter by night from New York's Hell's Kitchen. He is the masked vigilante Daredevil. Matt has a strong sense of morality and justice, which he carries with him in his work as a lawyer and a vigilante. While professional, Matt is not without a sense of humour and is very easygoing with his friends. Quips about his blindness don't bother him, and he even frequently jokes about it himself.",
