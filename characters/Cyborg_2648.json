    "description": "As a teenager, Cyborg was hideously mutilated in a car accident. Fortunately, his parents were foremost experts in cybernetic enhancements, so they integrated their son with a variety of advanced robotic components in order to save his life. For quite some time afterward, he was despondent about his change, and even in the series he remains somewhat unhappy with the loss of his normal life. But he retains a strong zest for life and devotes himself to making the best of his situation, to the extent he usually appears much happier than Robin does. As a cybernetically augmented human, Cyborg has several built in weapons (mainly a sonic cannon), the general resilience you'd expect of someone who's only partly squishy flesh and covered in armor, and super strength, as well as a considerable IQ that he puts to use as a Gadgeteer Genius.",
