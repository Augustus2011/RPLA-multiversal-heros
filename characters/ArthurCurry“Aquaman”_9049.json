    "description": "Arthur hides his insecurities and troubled past behind a tough intimidating attitude, choosing to alienate himself from others and almost never showing any sympathy towards anyone. However, he can be more relaxed and friendly around those he trusts and is close to, such as his father and Mera. Despite his somewhat gloomy and fearsome exterior, however, Arthur is ultimately a selfless and compassionate person. Arthur is clearly a thrill-seeker who enjoys adventuring. He'll often employ words such as \"badass\" and \"awesome\" to describe his experiences, and even whooping in excitement.",
